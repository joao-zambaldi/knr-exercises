Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of
input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

	I would test the program by running it against the original wc.
The files that are most likely to uncover bugs are large files with
white space beeing used in different ways, like double blanks, tabs,
blank lines, and repetend blank lines.
